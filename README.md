Run with python3 quizlet.py
I know it says spanish but you can use it with any language

Make sure there's some words in quizlet.txt before running, otherwise the program might act up.

The English side of the flashcard is given as a prompt twice as often as the spanish side.

When in "flashcard mode" (ie: the default state you enter when you run the program), to run comands, you must prepend a "-". Try running -h.
The only command in flashcard mode that isn't prepended by a minus is "find;<search query>".
If you ever find yourself in a menu where you don't know what to do, you can probably do x or -x to leave it.
The command "h" to bring up some helpful info works outside of flashcard mode in some places.

But yeah I made this bc it's more convenient for me to be able to add/remove/modify flashcards at any point very quickly. """quizlet""" also allows you to add multiple definitions of a word in both languages and will randomly select one to test you on (but you can answer in any word in the other language). For example: I have to try translated as intentar, probar and tratar. When prompted with "to try", I can respond with any of the three spanish answers. When the program chooses to ask me the spanish side, it will randomly choose one of the three words to prompt me with.
